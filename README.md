This paper presents a voxel-based technique for efficient error detection during the construction of buildings. Error detection in large scale building projects poses a set of problems for precision and performance due to the sheer amount of data in mesh topology and 3D scans. With the introduction of a voxel-based representation, this technique overcome the limitations posed by surface complexity for storage and computation. Expanding this representation with known methods of distance fields allows for constant-time lookup of the nearest surface voxel, which optimizes point deviation detection. Experiments on a real-world scenario demonstrate that the distance field search complexity follows a linear distribution O(N), based on the number of points. In addition, the initial distance field voxelization is shown to handle large typologies in ideal resolution, following the results of 475ms for a triangle count of 2.6 * 10^5 and grid resolution of 1024^3. These results demonstrate the technique's feasibility in large-scale computations.
